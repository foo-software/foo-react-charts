Note the following:
- Styles can be imported from this package - see the [example in Storybook](https://github.com/foo-software/foo-react-charts/blob/master/packages/react-charts-styleguide/src/stories/DonutChart.stories.tsx).
- Styles will try to use `Roboto Mono` Google font, so you can optionally [link it the way we do in Storybook](https://github.com/foo-software/foo-react-charts/blob/master/packages/react-charts-styleguide/.storybook/preview-head.html).
